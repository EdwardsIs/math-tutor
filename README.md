# math-tutor

This was my final in a introductory VB course.  The purpose of this program is to display example tables 
for addition and multiplication, based off of a user-entered value.  The program can also toggle between examples for 0-6, or examples for 0-12, depending on what grade level the user specifies while running the program.
