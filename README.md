# math-tutor

Overview

----------------

This was my final in an introductory VB course.  The purpose of this program is to display example tables 
for addition and multiplication, based off of a user-entered value.  The program can also toggle between examples for 0-6, or examples for 0-12, depending on what grade level the user specifies while running the program.


Files

---------------

The folder "EdwardsI_ElementaryTutor" includes the entire Visual Studio 2017 project, and the "publish" folder contains
the click once deployment files.
